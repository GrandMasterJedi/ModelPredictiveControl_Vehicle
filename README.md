# Demo of Model Predictive Control (MPC) for Autonomous Driving

A vehicle drives autonomously in a simulated environment, with its steering angle predicted by a dynamic model. The "model predictive" controller calculates the cross tracking error and optimize the vehicle trajectory based on an approximate dynamic vehicle motion model. 

This project is my solution to term 2, assignment 5 of the Udacity Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program

## Tips

1. It's recommended to test the MPC on basic examples to see if your implementation behaves as desired. One possible example is the vehicle starting offset of a straight line (reference). If the MPC implementation is correct, after some number of timesteps
(not too many) it should find and track the reference line.
2. The `lake_track_waypoints.csv` file has the waypoints of the lake track. You could use this to fit polynomials and points and see of how well your model tracks curve. NOTE: This file might be not completely in sync with the simulator so your solution should NOT depend on it.
3. For visualization this C++ [matplotlib wrapper](https://github.com/lava/matplotlib-cpp) could be helpful.)

## Reflection
### The Model
Student describes their model in detail. This includes the state, actuators and update equations.

### Timestep Length and Elapsed Duration (N & dt)
Student discusses the reasoning behind the chosen N (timestep length) and dt (elapsed duration between timesteps) values.
Additionally the student details the previous values tried.

### Polynomial Fitting and MPC Preprocessing
A polynomial is to waypoints.
If the student preprocesses waypoints, the vehicle state, and/or actuators prior to the MPC procedure it is described.

### Model Predictive Control with Latency
The student implements Model Predictive Control that handles a 100 millisecond latency. Student provides details on how they deal with latency.
